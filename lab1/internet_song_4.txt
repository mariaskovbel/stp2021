

I wanna be wild and young
And not be afraid to lose
Cry on my own
Me and my bottle
These are the things I choose

But they're watching me, judging me
Making me feel so used
Can't you see
That all I wanna do is

Get a little wild
Get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and
Not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me then
Go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong
I'm young

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I wanna fight
And fall off the tables
Then wait to regret last night
My heavy heart pounds deep like a dagger
'Cause I'm not afraid
To bite

But they're watching me, judging me
Making me feel so used
Can't you see
That all I wanna do is

Get a little wild
Get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and
Not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me then
Go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong
I'm young

Get a little wild
Get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and
Not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me then
Go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong
I'm young
