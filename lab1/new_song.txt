I'm down on my knees, I'm begging you please
To bite
Kiss a hundred boys and
All that fear and all that pressure
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
Love will keep you up tonight

So let me restart
Tell me, how do you?
I don't want my heart to break, baby
Me and my bottle
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight

What do you want from me when I just wanna restart
You won't find me in church (no!) reading the Bible (no!)
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna
And the truth is I'm better on my own
Tell me, how do you?

So let me restart
Tell me, how do you?
I don't want my heart to break, baby
Me and my bottle
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight

Oh, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
And I don't wanna live in the past
'Cause I'm not afraid
Worried that I'll be alone tonight
What do you want from me when I just wanna restart

So let me restart
Tell me, how do you?
I don't want my heart to break, baby
Me and my bottle
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
